--- 1. Install FFmpeg ---
Windows users should be able to download windows builds from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows and have a .bat
that will launch ffmpeg.

Mac users best install using Homebrew using Terminal (http://brew.sh/). Once Brew is installed use this command:
>brew install ffmpeg

Linux users best use their package managers. Theres a good chance that ffmpeg is called that under whichever distro you use
so for example Ubuntu/Linux Mint/Elementary users would type in:
>sudo apt-get install ffmpeg


--- 2. Obtain Song and Image ---
Best places to obtain a song would be iTunes, Bandcamp, Google Play or Lossless CD Rips. And images should be the album art,
but feel free to use another image, higher quality the image the better of course! Have these files ready in your file manager.


--- 3. The Magic! ---
Alright now that ffmpeg is set up and you have you're song and image it's time to begin!

Open the .bat on Windows and open Terminal on Mac and Linux.

This is the command you edit:
>ffmpeg -loop 1 -r 2 -i IMAGE.JPG -i SONG.FLAC -vf scale=-1080:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -tune stillimage -crf 18 -c:a copy -shortest -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 0 output.mkv

First off use the left/right arrow keys to move the cursor, completely delete the IMAGE.JPG placeholder and then drag in the image
into the terminal, you should now see the path to your image file inside the terminal. Make sure it is spaced nicely (should only
be one space between each setting/variable), and then repeat for the audio file.
Next you will want to consider the scale, I have it set at 1080:1080 which is good for sqaure album art, consider changing it
to 1920:1080 if your image is wider.
Lastly you can change output.mkv to what ever file name you want, But you can do that afterwards anyway. Press enter and wait.
